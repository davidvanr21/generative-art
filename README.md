## Concept

This project is all about me as a designer. What are my qualities? What kind of projects have I made in the past? You're going to find oyt more about who I am. This project excist out of two pages: 1. Landing page with my qualities as a designer with generated words and interactive hover 2. All of the projects I've made from when I was 8 years old.

## Features

`index.html`
There are two great features on this page. You can move your cursors over the text that is displayed, which will give you a sick effect. Also you can renew the page by clicking on the ðŸ”„ icon. This will give you a new word each time you refresh the page.

`timeline.html`
On this page you can drag the slider which will add more and more circles to the screen.

## Research & inspiration

## Process

In the first two weeks I was busy with getting to know the basics of the P5 Library and refreshing my knowledge about JavaScript. Which I found very hard. JavaScript can do a lot, but it's very hard to know everything about it. Fortunately, that is not necessary. The most important thing is to have a good concept so you can look up some things to realize it and make it work.

I did some exercises to get a feeling of what the possibilities are with P5. Watch all my skecthes in the online webeditor [here](https://editor.p5js.org/davidvanr21/sketches).

The first thing that I made was the animation of my name. My name itself excists out of shapes only, so that was a good exercise to . After that, I picked some examples from the P5.js website and changed values to see what happend. And also I started to make a function which allowed me to change words each time I pressed on a button. That didn't go well for a period, but it worked at the end.


### Future Proof

Some things that I had in mind, but didn't work already at the time I finished this project:
- [ ] Centering the words
- [ ] Only refresh the words, not the whole page
- [ ] Generate words from personal database
- [ ] Don't allow the algorithm to generate the same words in a row

## Reflection

My concept was good at the middle of the project. But I could have asked more feedback and help from my teacher and students around me. Because I've made the most important things at the end of the project, I couldn't iterate very good in terms of code. I would love to make the code work even better and put it on my online portfolio.
