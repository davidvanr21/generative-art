## Concept

This project is all about me as a designer. What are my qualities? What kind of projects have I made in the past? You're going to find oyt more about who I am. This project excist out of two pages: 1. Landing page with my qualities as a designer with generated words and interactive hover 2. All of the projects I've made from when I was 8 years old.

## Features

`index.html`
There are two great features on this page. You can move your cursors over the text that is displayed, which will give you a sick effect. Also you can renew the page by clicking on the "ðŸ”„" icon. This will give you a new word each time you refresh the page.

`timeline.html`
On this page you can drag the slider which will add more and more circles to the screen.

## Process

In the first two weeks I was busy with getting to know the basics of the P5 Library and refreshing my knowledge about JavaScript. Which I found very hard. JavaScript can do a lot, but it's very hard to know everything about it. Fortunately, that is not necessary. The most important thing is to have a good concept so you can look up some things to realize it and make it work.

Afgelopen week ben ik aan de slag gegaan met de basics van P5. Hiervoor heb ik wat verschillende video's gecheckt van de code train en ben ik oefeningen gaan doen om P5 een beetje mijn eigen te maken. Ik heb verschillende sketches aangemaakt in de online web editor om de oefeningen een beetje bij te houden.

Tijdens mijn proces heb ik veel uitgedacht en geschetst

### Future Proof

Some things that I had in mind, but didn't work already at the time I finished this project:
- [ ] Centering the words
- [ ] Only refresh the words, not the whole page
- [ ] Generate words from personal database
- [ ] Don't allow the algorithm to generate the same words in a row

## Reflection

My concept was good at the middle of the project. But I could have asked more feedback and help from my teacher and students around me. Because I've made the most important things at the end of the project, I couldn't iterate very good in terms of code. I would love to make the code work even better and put it on my online portfolio.
